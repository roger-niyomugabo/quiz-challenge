3. How fast can you deliver?
4. Can you improve based on feedback?
5. Can you use collaboration tools like git, GitHub?
6. Can you read documentation?

## Instructions

You are going to fork this repository and complete the introduction section with information about yourself then from there it's you. But if you are no sure how. Follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository. This basically means to make a copy of it hosted on your username(you need to be logged in on GitHub)
   Visit https://github.com/quarksgroup/quiz-challenge Click Fork button (top right) to establish a cloud-based fork.

2. Make sure you have git installed git on your machine(https://youtu.be/nbFwejIsHlY). Then clone your copy on your machine.

```sh
# using ssh
git clone git@github.com/<your-username>/quiz-challenge

# using https
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/quiz-challenge.git

# better yet using the github CLI(gh)
gh repo clone <your-username>/quiz-challenge
```

This where you get the urls to use in the previous step but remember to clone your fork of the repository and not this one:

3. Update the introduction section of this README.md and make a commit

```sh
# stage the changes
git add README.md

# commit the changes to git tracking
git commit

# or if you don't want to deal with your text editor
git commit -m "Message about what change you just made"
```

If you are in any trouble making commits refer to: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit

4. How to make a good commit message for your future self and your team.

- Git commit messages matter because they give other members of the team a clear overview of how the project has evolved. Please carefully read this guide Why good commit messages matter

- Also this repository does not accept commits that are not signed. This has been put in place to make sure malicious forces don't impersonate in of us in this team. To sign your commits you can follow this guide: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commit

5. For all the changes you will make you have to repeat the 3rd and 4th instructions for help.

6. The last step is to push the changes you have made back to GitHub.

```sh
# first a good developer mush make sure no one else has pushed changes they do not have locally
git pull origin main

# once that is done push their local changes
git push origin main
```

## Final words

We have provided help with the git workflow but now your project is done and has to be deployed somewhere. And that is part of the challenge. You have to choose a privider to host your challenge. Some will go with GitHub pages, Netlify or even Heroku, But hey don't limit yourself we want to see the explorer in you.

## Note

- Your should indicate where your project is hosted in your challenge's footer.
- Your fork that has your code should add a section with instructions on how someone could run your porject on their own machine. And you should assume that their laptop is brand with nothing but the operating system which could be Linux, Windows or MacOS. Which means you must provide instructions for all.
- If you encounter a challenge you can open an issue on this repository and decribe your problem. You can even include some screenshots.![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17580572/112598156-d7731400-8e16-11eb-9ee1-46b4de5c88fc.png)
- Remember reading, understanding and executing these instructions is part of the challenge.
